# MyInfo
Greetings!
My name is Elie El Helou.
I'm a communications and computer engineering student specializing in software development.
I mainly write code in Java and occasionally in C++ and my main focus is full stack development. I also like designing app interfaces.
That's all I have to share for now. Stay tuned for further developments!
